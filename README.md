# MOCS-CLAHE
Multi objective cuckoo search (MOCS) algorithm to tune contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization parameters. This algorithm uses CLAHE with Rayleigh PDF and it also optimizes the alpha parameter of Rayleigh PDF. It is programmed for grayscale images. The original code of MOCS was created Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb XS Yang (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74752-multiobjective-cuckoo-search-mocs)  
The bounds, population size and number of iterations of MOCS have been customized to process high magnification images of the ocular conjunctiva with the purpose of increasing the contrast of the vasculature with minimum noise amplification.  The objective functions are FNVE (fast noise variance etimation,Immerkaer J. Fast Noise Variance Estimation. Comput Vis Image Underst. 1996;64(2):300-302) and the conrast from GLCM.<br />
