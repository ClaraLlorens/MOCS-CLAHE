% This demo program only implements a standard version of         %
% Cuckoo Search (CS), as the Levy flights and generation of       %
% new solutions may use slightly different methods.               %
% The pseudo code was given sequentially (select a cuckoo etc),   %
% but the implementation here uses Matlab's vector capability,    %
% which results in neater/better codes and shorter running time.  % 
% This implementation is different and more efficient than the    %
% the demo code provided in the book by 
%    "Yang X. S., Nature-Inspired Optimization Algoirthms,        % 
%     Elsevier Press, 2014.  "                                    %

% 1) The constraint-handling is not included in this demo code.   %
% The main idea to show how the essential steps of cuckoo search  %
% and multi-objective cuckoo search (MOCS) can be done.           %
% 2) Different implementations may lead to slightly different     %
% behavour and/or results, but there is nothing wrong with it,    %
% as it is the nature of random walks and all metaheuristics.     %

% This algorithm has been modified to especifically enhance images of the
% ocular conjunctiva vasculature. It uses CLAHE with Rayleigh PDF and it also 
% optimizes the alpha parameter of Rayleigh PDF.  
%
% The input image is directly the third component of the tranformed RGB to 
% HSV image.
% 
% The lower and upper bounds for MOCS have
% been selected empirically for the given images which were taken using a
% slit-lamp biomicroscope. Population size and number of iterations 
% have been adapted to the specific problem of conjunctival 
% vasculature images.
%
% The objective functions are the image conrast from the GLCM
% and the noise calculated as Fast Noise Variance Estimation (FNVE), as in
% Immerkaer J. Fast Noise Variance Estimation. 
% Comput Vis Image Underst. 1996;64(2):300-302.
% 
% 
% The Pa has been modified so it is calculated adaptive for each iteration
% according to the method described by Reda et al. (2021) in 
% A novel cuckoo search algorithm with adaptive discovery probability based 
% on double Mersenne numbers. Neural Comput & Applic 33, 16377â€“16402.
